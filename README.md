# Custom Dynamic Optimization
Solve muscle redundancy problem through dynamic optimization in which tendon compliance and muscle force-length-velocity relationships are incorporated.

According to the 4th formulation in De Groote et al. (2016) paper. Muscle force-length-velocity and tendon force-length curves were modified as OpenSim implementation
